# Ad Campaign Data Analysis â€“ CIS 4100 Final Project

This project simulates and analyzes social media advertising campaign data using Python. It was developed for the CIS 4100 Data Visualization course at Baruch College.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to create, clean, manipulate, and visualize campaign and user data to understand ad performance across different target groups. It walks through realistic ad metrics such as CTR (Click Through Rate), CPC (Cost Per Click), and campaign budget efficiency.

## Features

- Simulated data for 1,000 users and multiple ad campaigns
- Denormalized nested JSON user/campaign structure into a flat DataFrame
- Extracted key campaign metadata (e.g., target age, gender, start/end dates)
- Calculated campaign performance metrics:
  - Click Through Rate (CTR)
  - Cost Per Click (CPC)
  - Cost Per Impression (CPI)
- Generated visual insights using Seaborn and Matplotlib
- Created pivot tables for demographic analysis

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.12+
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- Faker (for data simulation)
